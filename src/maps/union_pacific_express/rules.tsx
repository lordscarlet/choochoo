            Bailey Yard area may function as a transfer station.

          <p>
            When using Bailey Yard as a transfer station, a player may deliver a
            Good from its origin City to Bailey Yard and continue their delivery
            (&quot;transfer&quot;) to a destination City with a different Good
            from the Bailey Yard area, provided that the total number of Links
            used does not exceed their Links capacity. When transferring a Good
            in this manner, the Good delivered to Bailey Yard remains on Bailey
            Yard for future deliveries, and the Good transferred to the
            destination City is returned to the supply. All other rules for
            completing deliveries remain in effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            To use the transfer station, finish the first part of your delivery
            at Bailey Yard. You will then be able to continue your delivery
            using any of the cubes from Bailey Yard, using your remaining loco.
