/**
 * 4 Loco Map Settings
 *
 * Custom rules:
 * - All players start at engine level 4 (no Locomotive action)
 * - Exactly 4 links required per delivery
 * - Players may only use their own track for deliveries
 * - Delivery phase continues until all players pass consecutively
 *   (once a player passes, they are out until someone delivers, resetting passes)
 * - Each delivery always awards exactly 2 income
 * - Engine level does NOT count toward expenses
 * - All shares cost $3 (both voluntary share phase and forced emergency shares)
 * - Forced shares issued when player cannot afford expenses (up to share limit)
 * - Turn count: 2p→10, 3p→8, 4p→7, 5p→6, 6p→5
