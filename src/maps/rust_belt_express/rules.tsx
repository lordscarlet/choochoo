            <b>Build Track:</b> Track builds are $3 per tile, including
            redirects and all Complex Track and Towns. The interurban link
            between Toronto and Buffalo is similarly $3 and counts for 1 victory
            point at the end of the game.

            On turn 1 there is a two track tile build limit. The player
            selecting the Engineer Special Action may build up to three Track
            tiles. On remaining turns there is the usual three track tile build
            limit, with Engineer allowing up to four track tiles.

          <b>Urbanization:</b> The two goods on a new city&apos;s good growth
          chart are placed directly on the city when it is urbanized.

          <b>Move Goods:</b> Pittsburgh functions as a multi-colored City and
          accepts goods of all colors. When a black cube is delivered to
          Pittsburgh the active player receives $2 for this delivery.
        </li>

          <p>
            <b>First Move:</b> As usual, the selecting player is the first to
            move goods in both rounds of moving goods. Additionally, the
            selecting player may pay $2 per delivery to move a Good through one
            City matching the color of the Good being delivered (this includes
            Pittsburgh).

          <p>
            To utilize this mechanic, just perform your delivery as normal,
            continuing your path through the skipped city. The $2 fee will be
            applied automatically when you complete your delivery.
